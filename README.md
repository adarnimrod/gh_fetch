gh_fetch
========

Updater for your local copies of github repos. 

This tool is intended to go through your GitHub repos and fetch the most recent changes for it, creating any relevant directories in the process. Support for wildcard whitelists/blacklists is also in the plans.

Currently the tool can only fetch metadata but no git commands have been implemented yet.
